  <h1>FDIC-Failed-Bank-List-Research</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>As of July 21, 2024 speculation around changes in monetary and fiscal policy appear to be forecasted to have significate impact on the state of the debt market as the inflation rate has begun to shrink faster than the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expected.</p>
  <p>Choosing a segment of the financial industry with broad impacts to the state of the economy could help identify the validity of this thesis.</p>
  <p>Are commercial banks failures correlated to inflation rates?
  <p> While correlation does not determine causation, it could provide some clarity about the stability of the industry at the time of this research.</p>
  <p>Ploting the observations of bank failures on a graph where the X-axis represents time in years and Y-axis represents the number of Bank Failures.</p>
  <p>The null hypothesis will be that commercial bank failures are not influenced by monetary or fiscal policy changes. In other worlds we expect a slope of 0, no change.</p>
  <p>Conversely, the alternative hypothesis would be a slope that does not equal 0.</p>
  <p>Using the a CSV from <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fdic-failed-bank-list">Data.gov</a> with a list of all FDIC Failed Banks be can prove or disprove the null hypothesis.</p>
